    //BEISPIEL 01:

    // This defines a regular function named greet, which takes two parameters:
    // name: A string that represents the name of the person to greet.
    // callback: A function that will be executed after the greeting message is printed.

    function greet(name, callback) {
        console.log("Hello, " + name);
        callback();  // Callback function is executed here
    }

    // Erklärung:
    // First, the function logs "Hello, " + name to the console. 
    // This prints a greeting message that includes the value of name passed to the function.

    // After the greeting message is printed, the function executes callback(). 
    // This means that the callback function passed as an argument to greet will run at this point.

    // Calling the greet function:
  
    greet("Carlos", function() {
        console.log("This is the callback function!");
    });

    // The greet function is called with two arguments:
    // "Carlos": This is the value for the name parameter. It will be used to personalize the greeting message.
    // function() { console.log("This is the callback function!"); }: This is an anonymous function passed as the callback argument. 
    // It does not have a name, and it contains a console.log() statement that will print "This is the callback function!" when executed.

    // The greet function is executed with "Carlos" as the value for name, and the anonymous function as the callback.
    // Inside the greet function:
    // The statement console.log("Hello, " + name) is executed, which prints "Hello, Carlos".
    // After that, callback() is called. This triggers the anonymous function that was passed as the second argument to greet.
    // The anonymous function executes its console.log("This is the callback function!"), so this message gets printed as well.

    // Fazit: In this example, the callback is executed after the greeting message is printed, which demonstrates how callbacks allow you to execute additional logic after certain operations have completed. 
    // The callback allows you to define behavior that happens after the main function (in this case, the greeting) has been executed.
    
    
    // BEISPIEL 02: Simple function with and without callback -> Function that doubles the number and prints the result
    // This time we use a named function, not anonymous

    // Without callback:
    
    function double01(number) {

        let result = number * 2;  // Doubles the number
        console.log("The result is: " + result);  // Prints the result directly
    }

    // Calling the double function with the number
    double01(5);

    //------------------------------------------------------

    // With callback:

    function double02(number, callback) {
        let result = number*2;
        callback(result); // Passes the result to the callback function
    }

    //Inside the function, the number is doubled (let result = number * 2).
    // Instead of printing the result directly, the doubled value (result) is passed to the callback function, using callback(result).
    // By doing this, you’re essentially saying, “Hey, once I calculate the doubled value, please handle it with the callback function I passed.”

    function printResult(result) {
        console.log("The result is: " + result);
    }

    double02(5, printResult);

    // Explanation: We need to pass result indside the callback function and then access it inside printResult. This happens with callback(result);
    // The printResult function is defined to take a parameter called result. This is the value that is passed from the double02 function when the callback is called.
    // The printResult function is the callback function. It takes one parameter (result), which represents the data (the doubled value) that was passed from the double02 function.
    // Inside printResult, you access result to print it.

    // Fazit: You need to define the parameter (result) inside printResult to access the value passed by callback(result). 
    // Even though you have result in the double02 function, you need to pass it explicitly to the callback so that the callback can handle it.
    
    // The key idea is that callbacks are functions that handle results after a task is completed, and by passing result into the callback function, you ensure the callback has access to the data needed to proceed with its logic.
