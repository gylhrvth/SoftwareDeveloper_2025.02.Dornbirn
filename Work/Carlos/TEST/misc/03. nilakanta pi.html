        let result = 3; 

        for(let n = 2; n<=precision; n+=2){
            let divisor = (n*(n+1)*(n+2));
            let division = (4/divisor);

            if(n % 4 == 0){
                result -= division;
            } else {
                result += division;

    //Example of Nilakantha's Formula: 3 + 4/(2*3*4) - 4/(4*5*6) + 4/(6*7*8) - 4/(8*10*12) + 4/n*(n+1)*(n+2) - ... 

    /* Looking at the Formula, number 3 can be hard coded because it doesn't vary. 
       That's why - let result -  begins with a value of 3.
       The first divisor element of the formula begins with 2, multiplied by 3 and by 4.
       That's why n is declared with a value of 2 at the start in the for loop.
       Value n will keep on incrementing by 2 until the value of n reaches the value of precision.

       It increments by 2 because everytime a new divisor is added or substracted, the first value of the new divisor is always n+2. (First 2, then 4, then 6 and so on...)
       The divisor is made of three values that multiplicate each other, being value 1 = n, value 2 = n+1, value 3 = n+2. Example: 2*3*4 / 4*5*6 / 6*7*8
       
       The dividend of the formula is always 4, so we can hard code it as well.
       
       We use an if statement inside the for loop to determine for each iteration, if the new division will be added or substracted to number 3. (See Formula).
       
       We know that every divisor that begins with n = 4 or a multiple of 4 will be a substraction. 
       So we can say: if(n % 4 == 0), then add the division as a substraction (-=) to the result.
       All other n values will add the division as a sum (+=) to the result.

       For example: The first division starts with n=2 -> 4/(2*4*6)
       2 modulo 4 -> Number 4 is zero times in number 2. 
       2 = 4*0 + Modulo -> So we have that 2 = Modulo, it is not 0.

       Another example: 12 modulo 4 -> Number 4 is 3 times inside 12, no Restwert means modulo = 0.
       12 = 4*3(4 is 3 times in 12) + Modulo -> 12 = 12 + 0 

       Another example: 

       10 = 4*2(4 is 2 times inside 10) + 2 (modulo is 2, that is the number I need for 8 to reach 10).
