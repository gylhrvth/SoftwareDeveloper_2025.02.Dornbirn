        /* ErklÃ¤rung:

        00. In JavaScript, if result is initialized as a string (e.g., let result = "";), then any value appended to it using result += will be converted to a string. This is because the += operator, when used with a string, performs string concatenation.

        01. I start with a value (n). I want to find out which are the smallest prime numbers inside 100 that I can use to multiply them and get to n.

        02. For example, for 100 -> Which is the smallest prime number divisible with which I can divide 100?

        03. We always beginn with the smallest prime number, in this case 2. Is 100 divisible by 2? Yes -> 100 /2 = 50. Now n = 50.

        04. Until now we have used 2 (once).

        04. Now, is 50 divisible by 2? Yes, it's 25. Now n is 25.

        05. Until now we have used 2 twice.

        06. Is 25 divisible by 2? It isn't. So we fetch the next number, after 2 it is 3.

        07. Is 25 divisible by 3? No. So we fetch the next number, after 3 it is 4.

        08. Is 25 divisible by 4? No. So we fetch the next number, after 4 it is 5.

        09. Is 25 divisible by 5? Yes. 25/5 = 5. Until now we have used 2 (twice) and 5 (once). Now n = 5.
        
        10. Is 5 divisible by our current divisor 5? Yes. 5/5 = 1. Until now we have used 2 (twice) and 5 (twice).

        11. In the beginning, n was 100. Now n equals 1. Because n is not bigger than 1 anymore, the while loop stops.
