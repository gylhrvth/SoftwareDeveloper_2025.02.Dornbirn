    // Exercise 1: Simple Function

    function greet01(name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }

    // Task: Convert the greet function into an arrow function.

    let greet02 = (name)=> {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }

    // Explanation: The arrow function is equivalent to the regular function but in a more concise form.
    // It takes one parameter, name, and returns a string that greets the name.

    //Simplifying Further:

    let greet03 = (name)=> "Hello, " + name + "!";

    let greet04 = name => "Hello, " + name + "!";

    // Important!!: The reason this works without using return and without braces is because arrow functions in JavaScript have an implicit return feature when they consist of a single expression.
    // The absence of braces {} indicates that the function consists of just one expression. This expression is immediately returned.

    // Breakdown:
    // The function takes name as an argument.
    // The expression "Hello, " + name + "!" is evaluated.
    // Since there are no braces ({}), this is treated as a single expression, and its result is automatically returned.
